Four files in this directory (```.bashrc```, ```.dir_colors```, ```.git-completion.bash``` and ```.git-prompt.sh```) provide
bash colourization and tools for convinient work with git in the console interface (git tab completion and git repository status).

Copy these files to your home directory and relog in the terminal to apply new settings.

```.git-completion.bash``` and ```.git-prompt.sh``` are provided without any changes to the original files.

In ```.dir_colors``` you can set the colours for ```ls``` command for any type of files in your system.

Provided ```.bashrc``` file includes:

1. ```.git-completion.bash``` and ```.git-prompt.sh``` load;
2. settings for console prompt;
3. settings for ```ls``` colourization using ```.dir_colors```;
3. aliases for ```ls```, ```rm```, ```cp```, ```mv``` commands to make them more safe and convinient.
